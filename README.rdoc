= health_check

Simple health check of Rails app for use with Pingdom, NewRelic, EngineYard or uptime.openacs.org etc.

The basic goal is to quickly check that rails is up and running and that it has access to correctly configured resources (database, email gateway)

The email gateway is not checked unless the smtp settings have been changed.
Specify full or include email in the list of checks to varify the smtp settings
(eg use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost). 

health_check provides various monitoring URIs 

    % curl localhost:3000/health_check
    success

    % curl localhost:3000/health_check/standard
    success

    % curl localhost:3000/health_check/all
    success

    % curl localhost:3000/health_check/site_and_database_and_email_migrations
    success

The health_check controller disables sessions and logging for its actions to minimise the impact of frequent uptime checks on the session store and the log file.

== Installation

=== As a Gem from rubygems (Rails 3.0 and above)

Add the following line to Gemfile

    gem "health_check"

Then run 

    % bundle

=== As a Gem from rubygems (Rails 2.3)

Install the gem using the following command

    % gem install health_check    

Then add the following line to config/environment.rb within the config block

    config.gem "health_check"

=== As a Plugin (Rails 2.3.x)

Run the following commands from the root of your rails application

    % cd vendor/plugins
    % git clone git://github.com/ianheggie/health_check.git

=== Standalone for testing the gem 

Using rbenv or rvm, install and set the version of ruby you wish to test against.
You will need to install the bundler gem if using rbenv.
See the .travis.yml file for a list of supported ruby versions.

    rbenv shell 1.8.7-p371
    # or 
    rvm use 1.9.3

Create a temp directory for throw away testing, and clone the health_check gem into it

    mkdir -p ~/tmp
    cd ~/tmp
    git clone https://github.com/ianheggie/health_check.git

Configure which rails version you want to test against, and load the gems appropriate for the ruby version

    cd ~/tmp/health_check

    export BUNDLE_GEMFILE=rails2_3.gemfile
    # or
    export BUNDLE_GEMFILE=rails3_0.gemfile
    # or
    export BUNDLE_GEMFILE=rails3_1.gemfile
    # or
    export BUNDLE_GEMFILE=rails3_2.gemfile

    # Install required gems
    bundle install --binstubs
    rbenv rehash  # if using rbenv

Run the tests

    cd ~/tmp/health_check

    # Run tests 
    bin/rake test

== Uptime Monitoring

Use a website monitoring service to check the url regularly for the word "success" rather than just a 200 return code.

See
* Pingdom Website Monitoring - https://www.pingdom.com
* NewRelic Availability Monitoring - http://newrelic.com/docs/features/availability-monitoring-faq
* Uptime by OpenACS - http://uptime.openacs.org/uptime/
* Engine Yard's guide - https://support.cloud.engineyard.com/entries/20996821-monitor-application-uptime (although the guide is based on fitter_happier plugin it will also work with this gem)
* Any other montoring service that can be set to check for the word success in the test returned from a url

== Checks

* standard (default) - site, database and migrations checks are run plus email if settings have been changed
* all / full - all checks are run
* database - checks that the current migration level can be read from the database
* email - basic check of email - :test returns true, :sendmail checks file is present and executable, :smtp sends HELO command to server and checks response 
* migration - checks that the database migration level matches that in db/migrations
* cache - checks that a value can be written to the cache
* site - checks rails is running sufficiently to render text

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
